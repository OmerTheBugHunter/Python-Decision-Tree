# Python-Decision-Tree
This repository includes the codes to implement the "Decision Tree" algorithm and to use it with a dataset.

1) Download the dataset "data_banknote_authentication.csv" and "decision_tree.ipynb".
2) All parts of the implementation are ready and explained with comments.

Code performs:
1) Reading and loading the data to DataFrame.
2) Scaling and splitting the data.
3) Sending the data to Decision Tree models.
  - There are two Decision Tree models with max_depth=3 and max_depth=5.
4) Calculating the accuracy, precision and F1 scores of the both models.
5) Creating Classification Report.
6) Plotting Confusion Matrix and Feature Importances.
